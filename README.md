Project 1: Interactive Front-End Application
This project will be a centerpiece for your portfolio and your first opportunity to show employers your collaborative skills and coding abilities. Employers want to see what you can do, but they also want to see how you work with other developers. The more examples of deployed collaborative work you have in your portfolio, the more likely you are to get an interview and a job. One of the requirements for this project is that you add it to your portfolio.

Project Requirements
With your team, you'll conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. You'll also learn about agile development methodologies to help you work collaboratively. You'll implement feature and bug fixes using Git branch workflow and pull requests.

You'll write your own user stories and acceptance criteria in GitHub Issues to help your team stay on track with the project. Using GitHub Project to track the status of your project tasks will help you understand the benefits of Kanban boards.

You and your group will use everything you’ve learned to create a real-world front-end application that you’ll be able to showcase to potential employers. The user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfill the following requirements:

Use Bootstrap.

Be deployed to GitHub Pages.

Be interactive (in other words, accept and respond to user input).

Use at least two server-side APIsLinks to an external site..

Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).

Use client-side storage to store persistent data.

Be responsive.

Have a polished UI.

Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, and so on).

Have a quality README (including a unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to the deployed application).

Presentation Requirements
Use this project presentation templateLinks to an external site. to address the following:

Elevator pitch: a one minute description of your application

Concept: What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?

Process: What were the technologies used? How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?

Demo: Show your stuff!

Directions for Future Development

Links to the deployed application and the GitHub repository

Grading Requirements
NOTE
If a project submission is marked as “0”, it is considered incomplete and will not count towards your graduation requirements. Examples of incomplete submissions include the following:

A repository that has no code

A repository that includes a unique name but nothing else

A repository that includes only a README file but nothing else

A repository that only includes starter code
